## 🤔 FAQs

<!-- ### ❓ The scraper is only retrieving 5 results. How can I scrape all Google Maps search results?
A: Open the file `src/config.py` and delete the line that sets the `max_results` parameter.

By doing so, you can scrape all the Google Maps Listing. For example, to scrape all restaurants in Delhi, modify the code as follows:
```python
queries = [
    {
        "keyword": "restaurants in delhi",
    },
]
```
Note: You will be able to scrape up to 120 leads per search due to Google's scrolling limitation. Technically, there is no way possible to bypass this limitation. -->

### ❓ I want to scrape search results for a specific search query. How can I do that?
A: Open the file `src/config.py` and update the `keyword` with your desired search query.

For example, if you want to scrape leads about Digital Marketers in Kathmandu 🇳🇵, modify the code as follows:
```python
queries = [
    {
        "keyword": "digital marketers in kathmandu",
    },
]
```

Note: You will be able to scrape up to 120 leads per search due to Google's scrolling limitation. Technically, there is no way possible to bypass this limitation.

### ❓ Can I scrape more than one query using this script?
A: Easy! Open `src/config.py` and add as many queries as you like.

For example, if you want to scrape restaurants in both Delhi 😎 and Bangalore 👨‍💻, use the following code:
```python
queries = [
    {
        "keyword": "restaurants in delhi",
    },
    {
        "keyword": "restaurants in bangalore",
    }
]
```

### ❓ I want to scrape only the first 5 results. How can I do that?

Absolutely! Open `src/config.py` and modify the `max_results` parameter.

For example, if you want to scrape the first 5 restaurants in Bangalore, use the following code:

```python
queries = [
    {
        "keyword": "restaurants in Bangalore",
        "max_results": 5,
    }
]
```

### ❓ How to Scrape Additional Information like Website, Phone, Geo Coordinates, Price Range?

You may upgrade to the Pro Version of the Google Maps Scraper to scrape additional data points, like:

- 🌐 **Website**
- 📞 **Phone Numbers**
- 🌍 **Geo Coordinates**
- 💰 **Price Range**
- And **26 more data points** like Owner details, Photos, About Section, and [many more](https://github.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/blob/master/pro-docs.md#-what-data-points-are-scraped-by-the-pro-version)!
